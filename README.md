# d3-arclabels

This D3 4.0 plugin is used with pie and donut charts to create an additional path which
contains a single arc in the middle of the segment. This path contains an ID that can be
used in a text-path statement to bind some text to the arc. It is up to the user to ensure
that the text fits on the arc. If the data contains a 'cw' value it is used to indicate
whether the path is clockwise or counterclockwise. This is used to 'flip' the text so that
it is readable at the bottom of a chart. 

## Installing
